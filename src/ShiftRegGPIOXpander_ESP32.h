 * @brief Header file for the ShiftRegGPIOXtender_ESP32 library 
 * 
 * @details The library provides the means to extend the GPIO available pins -**for digital output only**- by providing a pin output manipulation API similar to the provided by Arduino, for it's own GPIO pins, for shift registers attached to the controller. The class and related definitions are provided for 74HCx595 shift registers connected to the MCU by the required three pins for the first chip, daisy-chained to other similar chips as much as needed and technically supported (please read the datasheet of the selected model for references about those limits).

    * Instantiates a ShiftRegGPIOXpander object, the parameters provide the pins used to communicate with the shift registers and the number of shift registers composing the expander. 8-bits will be added with every shift register connected in a daisy-chain arrangement.  
    * 
    * @param ds MCU GPIO pin connected to the DS pin -a.k.a. serial data input (DIO)- pin of the 74HCx595 to send data serially to the expander
    * @param sh_cp MCU GPIO pin connected to the SH_CP pin -a.k.a. shift register clock input- of the 74HCx595 to manage the communication's clock line to the expander
    * @param st_cp MCU GPIO pin connected to the ST_CP pin -a.k.a. storage register clock input- to set (latch) the output pins from the internal buffer of the expander
    * @param srQty Optional parameter. Quantity of shift registers set in daisy-chain configuration composing the expander.
    * 
    * @note The object will create a dynamic array to buffer the information written to the shift registers, it will be referred to as the **Main Buffer**, **the Buffer** or **the Main**.  
    * The action of sending the Buffer contents to the shift registers array will be reffered as **Flushing**. Every time the Buffer is **flushed** to the shift registers array the whole contents of that array will be sent.  
    * A secondary dynamic array will be created for delayed operations purposes, that buffer will be referred to as the **Auxiliary Buffer** or **the Auxiliary**. The Auxiliary will be created every time it's needed and destroyed after it's temporary use becomes unnecessary. The Auxiliary will be used to allow several bit changing operations without the need of flushing the whole buffer for each bit change. The usual propper use of the mechanism will make all the bits changes that occur simultaneously to the Auxiliary Buffer and then **moving** the Auxiliary Buffer to the Main Buffer and flushing the Buffer.

This procedure is enforced to guarantee buffer contents consistency and avoid any loss of modifications done to the Auxiliary. The digitalReadSr(const uint8_t) method will also invoke a moveAuxToMain() before returning the requested pin state. See digitalReadSr(const uint8_t) for more information.

/**
 * @brief A class that models **Virtual Ports** from  the resources provided by a ShiftRegGPIOXpander object.  
 * 
 * The **Virtual Ports** are  sets of pins that can be used as a group, and are defined by the user. The pins are a contiguous subset of the pins available in the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object. The **Virtual Ports** main advantage is to provide a means to focus on a group of pins that are somehow associated: are meant to manage the communications with a specific device or group of devices, manage different related signals, etc.  
 * 
 * The class objects provide the means to translate the pin numbers from the **Virtual Port** to the real pins in the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object.  
 * 
 * A simple example use case is a crossroads traffic light controller, four different traffic lights, one for each direction, totalling 12 pins, might be solved by using a ShiftRegGPIOXpander object with 2 shift registers. Using the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object directly would require the user to remember that the first pin of the first traffic light is pin 0, the second traffic light starts at pin 3, and so on. Using a SRGXVPort object for each traffic light would allow the user to create a virtual port for each traffic light. Pin 0 of each virtual port would be the red light, pin 1 would be the yellow light, and pin 2 would be the green light. The user would then be able to use the virtual port objects to manipulate the traffic lights without having to convert each light to the real pin numbers in the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object, and make the addition of new traffic lights easier, as the managing methods would be the same for each virtual port.  
 * 
 * @note The SRGXVPort class has set a maximum of 16 pins that can be used in each virtual port. The number of pins assigned will be checked against the maximum number of pins available in the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object.  
 * 
 * @note The open possibility of creating virtual ports that overlap pins in the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object is not considered a problem, even if one virtual port includes all the pins of another virtual port. Take as an example the case of the x86 Intel processors, where the 64-bits registers are a superset of the 32-bits registers, the 32-bits registers are a superset of the 16-bits registers and the 16-bits are superset of 8-bits registers, with the possibility of managing the 64 bits at once or subsets by using the corresponding designations provided. The user can manage the virtual ports as they see fit, but the library will not provide any mechanism to prevent overlapping virtual ports.  
 * 
 * @warning The SRGXVPort class uses the buffer memory provided by the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object to handle the pins state. The user might decide to use the SRGXVPort objects to manipulate the pins state, or use the ShiftRegGPIOXpander object directly. The classes are designed to allow the user to use both methods, but the user must be aware that the state of a pin might be modified by the shiftRegGPIOXpander object directly, and by any and all the SRGXPVPort objects that same pin is part of.
